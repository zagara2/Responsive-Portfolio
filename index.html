		<h1>About Me</h1>

		<img src = "assets/images/mickey2.jpg" class = "auth-image mickeypic" alt = "It's me!">

		<p>Marimikael (a.k.a. Mickey) Seibert is a fan of biology, herbalism, gaming, techno and radio - but most importantly, she loves computers! Although fascinated by machines her whole life, Mickey truly discovered her passion for programming while studying cognitive psychology at Duke University, intrigued by the analogy of the brain to a computer regarding the way that each entity processes information. Additionally, having studied languages her whole life, Mickey was drawn in by the idea of programming as “learning to communicate effectively with machines”, or “learning to speak computer.”  Upon graduating, she sought out further computer science education at UNC Chapel Hill, as well as doing a large amount of self-study and learning from family and friends who have experience in the field. As a software engineer, she hopes to use the intersection of coding and biopsychology to help demystify the human mind, forging new territory in the fields of AI and medicine. Peace, love, and w4r3z, yo. </p>

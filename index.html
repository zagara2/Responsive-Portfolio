		<img src = "assets/images/mickey2.jpg" class = "auth-image" alt = "It's me!">

		<p>Marimikael (a.k.a. Mickey) Seibert is a fan of techno, swimming, gaming, fashion and radio - but most importantly, she loves computers! Having been fascinated by machines her whole life, she is now nurturing a budding interest in programming. Her ultimate goal is to live as a super-hacker in a secluded cabin near a lake - spending her days fishing, and also phishing. Peace, love, and w4r3z, yo. </p>

# Responsive Portfolio Site

## What is it?
A portfolio site on which I showcase all of my projects to date, as well as an "About Me" section and a contact form. 

The site is currently deployed at https://zagara2.github.io/Responsive-Portfolio/ .

## Technologies Used
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Javascript
* JQuery

## Browser Tests

The site has been tested on Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer. It works as it should on all of these browsers. 

Plans to test on Safari are upcoming.

## Future Plans for Improvement
 * Contact form is a placeholder at the moment for when I will eventually set it up to forward messages to my email. for now, send messages to marimikaels@gmail.com instead of sending messages via the contact form.

# Responsive Portfolio Site

## What is it?
A portfolio site on which I showcase all of my projects to date, as well as an "About Me" section and a contact form. 

The site is currently deployed at https://zagara2.github.io/Responsive-Portfolio/ .

## Technologies Used
* HTML5
* CSS3

## Browser and Screen Compatibility

### Browser Tests

The site has been tested on Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer. It works as it should on all of these browsers. 

Plans to test on Safari are upcoming.

### Screen Compatibility Tests

The site is best viewed on a small desktop (1280x1024), but looks good on essentially any modern device's screen resolution. This includes both a 10" and 12" Netbook, a 13" and 15" notebook, 19"-24" desktops, Kindle Fire, Asus Nexus 7, iPad and iPad Pro, Samsung Galaxy tab, Microsoft Surface Pro, iPhone 3 and up (including iPhone 6-7 plus), Galaxy S2 and up, LG G 3-5, and 480p, 720p and 1080p televisions.

Here is the desktop layout of the site, as it should look when loaded properly on a larger screen:

On a somewhat smaller desktop, or on a tablet:

Here is the mobile layout of the site, as it should look when loaded properly:
